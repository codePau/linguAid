Linguaid is an add-on that makes easier for learners of any level to understand technical texts. When reading any website in which technical terms appear, just select the unknown word(s), right-click and select the option Linguaid on the menu. A cloud with tags related with the selected term will appear in the screen.
These tags allow to link the term with other terms related, classifying it in a known environment. Once seen, click in the cloud for making it disappear andâ€¦keep reading and learning!
